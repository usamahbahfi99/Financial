# Analysis of Company Financial Data
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing company financial data for 2023. The data used includes information about revenues, costs and profits, including financial report dates. This analysis helps in understanding financial trends, detects seasonal patterns, and provides insights that can support more informed business decisions.
## Project Objectives
- Identify and analyze revenue and profit trends throughout 2023.
- Calculate profit margin every month to measure business efficiency.
- Using a predictive model to forecast next year's revenue (2024).
- Determine the best and lowest performing months based on profit.
- Develop strategic recommendations to increase revenue and business efficiency.
## Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Cleaning data from missing or inconsistent values.
    - Converts a date column to a datetime type to enable time-based analysis.
    - Group data by month for trend analysis and seasonal patterns.
2. Revenue and Profit Analysis:
    - Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation for revenues, costs, and profits.
    - Create graphs to show monthly trends in revenue and profit during 2023.
    - Calculate the profit to cost ratio every month and visualize it in a graph.
3. Predictive Model:
    - Using linear regression to predict revenue based on costs.
    - Uses ARIMA model to project 2024 revenue based on trends from 2023.
## Results and Findings
- Descriptive Statistics: Analysis shows that revenue and profits will fluctuate throughout 2023. Profits tend to be influenced by varying operating costs.
- Revenue and Profit Trends: The graph shows the monthly trends of revenue and profit, with some months showing significant increases and other months seeing decreases.
- Profit to Cost Ratio: The analysis shows variations in the profit to cost ratio on a monthly basis, indicating different levels of efficiency.
- Revenue Projections for 2024: The ARIMA model estimates revenues for 2024 are likely to be stagnant with a slight decline, providing important information for business strategy planning.
- Highest and Lowest Profit Months: Analysis shows the months with the highest and lowest profits, helping companies understand performance patterns throughout the year.
## Conclusion
This project provides comprehensive insight into the company's financial performance during 2023. With this information, companies can identify revenue and profit patterns, determine appropriate strategies to increase revenue, and plan for 2024 with projections based on trend analysis. These projections also provide guidance for anticipating potential future challenges and opportunities, enabling companies to make more effective and informed business decisions.
